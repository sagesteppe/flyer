These data detail the route of the Western Flyer for a time in the Spring of 1940 when Ed Ricketts and John Steinbeck journeyed to the Sea of Cortez to collect from the intertidal zone. More information about them, including examples of what they look like, can be found on https://sagesteppe.github.io/flyer. They are designed for example cartograhic purposes in command line GIS programs, largely R and Python, and hence are greatly simplified for file size.
