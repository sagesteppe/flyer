Description: I often find that I need new geospatial data for playing around with cartographic tricks. A normal challenge for me is plotting points and linestrings on large geographic expanses. Here I digitize the locations from The Log from the Sea of Cortez, Ed Ricketts and John Steinbecks legendary collection trip.
