```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```


```{r install package}
devtools::install_github('sagesteppe/cortez')
```

The Penguin Classics map has many wonderful attributes worth emulating. 

```{r setup}
library(cortez)
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
```

The places visited by the collectors can be loaded using `places`, and the route they took (which I made up) can be loaded via `routes``. 

```{r}
data(places)
head(places)
```

Because the package is attached we can also just start using the data, which is currently held as a promise. 

```{r}
data(route)
plot(route[,'date_arrive'])

route <- left_join(route, st_drop_geometry(places), by = c('Destination' = 'location.english'))
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = route, aes(color = date_arrive))
```
