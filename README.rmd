# flyer
Geographic data from Steinbeck and Ricketts 1940 trip to the Sea of Cortez.
This is the original R package, which includes the data cleaning, while the python package just includes the data. 

# Installation

`flyer` is available only on github. It can be installed using remotes or devtools like so:

```
install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('sagesteppe/flyer')

# remotes is very similar and a good alternative for this use case.
install.packages('remotes') 
remotes::install_github('sagesteppe/flyer')
```

Once installed it can be attached for use like any other package from github or CRAN

```
library(flyer)
```

## Data Accuracy 

The original author is not a marine ecologist, nor nautically inclined; rather they appreciate the journey as a philosophical exploration of ecology. 

The goal of this package is to provide a readily available data set for cartographic activities. 
In particular, a data set composed of point, and linestring geometries, rather than polygons for typical choropleth applications - such as the North Carolina SIDS data set which comes with `sf`. 
Additional advantages of the data set is that it follows a sequential series of events, allowing for intelligent use of story maps, interactive, or animations. 

Consider the package very alive, which is to say I am very happy to merge increasingly accurate collection localities, or routes. 
I have only read the *Log form the Sea of Cortez*, and not *Sea of Cortez: A Leisurely Journal of Travel and Research*, or any of the other true catalogs from the voyage. 
I have quickly poked through Brusca 2020, a wonderful read, which served as the definitive source for locations. 

The 'route' of the Western Flyer is liberally digitized and redrawn from Penguin Classics 1995 edition of *The Log from the Sea of Cortez*; of which I am not sure of the actual accuracy of. 
I further embellished curvatures and shapes to make the data set aesthetically appealing. 
If you think you know the real route, as I guess would have been supplied by the *Flyer* (actual nautical book), let me know and I am happy to try and digitize it when I can find the time. 
However, if that happens, I will maintain both the aesthetic, and the authentic routes as data sets in the package. 

## Contributing

As mentioned, I use this data set for testing our cartographic approaches. 
If you are a marine biologist, into data viz, or mariner and think you have some insight - but are hesitant about this whole Github thing - shoot me an email and we can try and figure out how to incorporate your perspectives.
